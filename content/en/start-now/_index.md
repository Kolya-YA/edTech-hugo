reasons:
    - "After each topic you learn, you do practical homework and receive feedback from the tutor."
    - "If you encounter any difficulties, you can always have an individual consultation with the tutor and close the gaps."
    - "During the training you will create a project: a part of a functioning website, an application, a module, an online store, or any other project, which can be both social and commercial."
    - "The learning process is structured in stages and its effectiveness has been well proven through years of practice - we have been teaching IT-professions since 1993."
    - "The tutors are exclusively practicing professionals from Israel, Germany, USA, Russian-speaking programmers and project managers, candidates and doctors of science."
